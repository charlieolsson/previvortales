## Hi, I'm Eve.

I'm no one special, just your stock-standard 27 year old, and the face behind Previvor Tales.

When I was 16 years old, I was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome - a hereditary predisposition to a number of different cancers. This means, I have a much higher risk of developing cancer (including bowel, endometrial and ovarian cancer), and possibly at a much younger age than the general population.

### So how did I come to be diagnosed?

At 38 years of age, my dad was diagnosed with Stage III bowel cancer. A pretty uncommon diagnosis for such a young person. But this didn’t surprise him, as much as did my brother and I. It turns out that his father, my grandfather, also received a bowel cancer diagnosis at a young age, when he was just 42.

I was 14 years old when my dad was diagnosed with bowel cancer, and as a family, we survived it – together. It involved lots of medication and pretty awful times, but we are closer (and stronger) for it.

After dad finished his treatment, he was delivered the news that his early onset cancer was due to a genetic mutation – called[ Lynch syndrome](https://lynchsyndrome.org.au/). Shortly after, I turned 16 and was tested. My results showed I was positive for the mutation, and thankfully, my brother was not.

**I’m 27 years old now, and totally cancer-free.**

I feel constantly grateful for the knowledge and power that I have, that my family, before me, did not.

## So, Lynch syndrome was it?

You'd be forgiven for never having heard of Lynch syndrome. It's not particularly well known.

Unfortunately, it's far more common than you probably think. I recently read that about 1 in 300 people have Lynch syndrome. Yep, you read that right, _1 in 300_!

That's a pretty startling (and completely unacceptable) statistic for a condition that get little public awareness!

## So, why start Previvor Tales?

My Lynch syndrome diagnosis, along with my dad having had cancer, changed my life. I spent a lot of time studying at university about cancer, volunteered with charities, hosted fundraising events and basically wanted to be involved however and whenever I could.

That has led me here.

To this website, to this blog.

Because, in reality, in our world today - **this is where the magic happens**. Online and on social media.

And I'm hoping, this can be the start of something good.

I  started Previvor Tales in response to two big problems I believe need addressing:

## 1. There is a big need for better support

When I was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, I was on my own. I had my family, but do you think that any of my year 16 year old friends had any clue what it meant to be told "you tested positive' for this genetic mutation? Even now, if it weren't for my volunteering, I wouldn't really have met anyone else affected by this. I have felt pretty isolated in this.

> _And this is something I want to change. I don't want anyone else to feel as alone as I did._

I look at so many incredible people doing wonderful things for cancer awareness, for people affected by a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and think to myself…wow, truly, wow!

How incredible it is that these wonderful support networks exist. Places to feel at home, places to feel understood, places to genuinely connect with others. And then I feel saddened, that there isn't quite anything like that Lynch syndrome (and some of the other hereditary cancer mutations). Well not yet.

I'm hoping this can be the start of something.

Whatever your mutation - MSH2, MSH6, BRCA1, FAP, CAD2, you are so welcome here. I'm no medical expert, and certainly not a counsellor, but I am a human being. One who is also living with this.

Feeling like you're alone. Well, you're not. I'm here!

## 2. There is an overwhelming lack of awareness about Lynch syndrome

Awareness equals knowledge, knowledge equals power, and that power, saves lives!

It is believed that [1-5% of bowel cancers](https://www.cancer.nsw.gov.au/understanding-cancer/cancer-in-nsw/hereditary-cancers/lynch-syndrome) and [3-5% of endometrial cancers](https://www.sgo.org/clinical-practice/guidelines/screening-for-lynch-syndrome-in-endometrial-cancer/) are Lynch syndrome-related.

_Just imagine if those people knew first._

Imagine if they could arm them selves, be proactive, have surveillance, get a kick-ass medical team behind them and a support network.

Lynch syndrome does just that. It gives you the chance to do all of those things. To give you hope that your cancer won't slip under the radar, or be diagnosed too late.

> I don't believe that anyone should ever die of cancer. EVER.

Lynch syndrome is a magical gift of knowledge, of insight and hopefully, the more that people become aware of this and start to look at their own families and be diagnosed, we can take a step closer toward a world where we know where people can avoid this devastating disease.

So please, now that you're here, take a look around and if nothing else, I ask that you help spread awareness by sharing this page with your friends and family. It's time to save lives people!
